# SQUASH**AI** media repository
Media files for AI processing

An example for accessing the files is available at
https://squashai.github.io/media (but works only disabling CORS in the
browser).


## NOTE: Currently Unusable

Due to github.com not supporting pre-flight CORS check (OPTIONS before
POST), there's no way to access `git-lfs` content from the browser.

GitLab.com on the other hand provides permanent links and works quite
decently at storing large files: https://gitlab.com/squashai/media
